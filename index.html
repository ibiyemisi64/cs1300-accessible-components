        <div>
          <p>A dropdown menu is a fundamental UI component that enhances navigation by organizing options efficiently.
            However,
            accessibility varies across implementations. This case study explores how dropdown menus function using mouse,
            keyboard, and touch interactions, analyzing their usability and accessibility. </p>

          This section showcases the original dropdown menus from <strong>Google’s user profile menu, Apple’s system
            menu, and
            ChatGPT’s interface</strong>.
          By analyzing these designs, I identified key differences in <strong>interaction methods, accessibility
            features, and
            usability trade-offs</strong> across platforms.

        <p>Below, you’ll see two separate state models, each focusing on mouse and keyboard interactions. These diagrams
          help us visualize how a user navigates through different states when using a dropdown menu.
          This first diagram reflects the Apple Menu that I analyze previously, and the second diagram is an newly designed state model that targets specific tradeoffs.</p>

        <h3 class="py-4" >Updated State Model: Apple Menu</h3>
        <!-- <p>In this redesign, I introduced several state updates to improve learnability and memorability by using common interactions that may be familiar to the user in hopes that they will learn how to use the dropdown quickly. For mouse users, menu items now select on press instead of release, creating a more immediate interaction that is similar to the other drop down menus that I analyzed. The active state now features a blue outline when the menu is open, providing a higher emphasize for mouse users and keyboard users to know which menu bar item is open. Additionally, the selected state mimics a pressed button rather than briefly flashing a blue background, enhancing memorability by implementing an affordance of what a button looks like after it is pressed. For keyboard users, I added Tab navigation between menu items, aligning with the other drop down menus that allow the users to tab between item, to improve consistency and memorability across different systems.

          However, these changes introduce a trade-off in efficiency. Mouse users now need to be more precise, as accidental clicks can lead to unintended selections. For keyboard users, while Tab navigation improves usability, it may slow down interaction in large menus where arrow keys alone would have been a quicker way to navigate. These trade-offs highlight the balance between learnability, memorability, and efficiency, ensuring a streamlined experience at the cost of some interaction accuracy and speed.</p>

          <h2 class="py-4">Reflection</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>In terms of accessibility, the Apple Menu was the most accessible for all four users and even highlighted keyboard shortcuts in the menu. However, the Google menu and ChatGPT menu lacked functionality for keyboard users since there were items that could not be accessed via the keyboard. In terms of usability, ChatGPT included descriptions that are helpful for new users.</li>
            
            <li>An accessibility consideration in the redesign was that the original flashing menu item when selected could affect users sensitive to flashing elements. Instead, I updated the design to mimic a button being pressed and removed the flash.</li>
            
            <li>A mismatch in the menu was a tab being used to close the menu. Typically, keyboard users interact with items using Tab for navigation down and Tab + Shift for navigation up but the Apple Menu assumes the user will only use arrows. I addressed this mismatch by updating the menu states to use only <strong>CTRL + C</strong> to close the menu and kept Tab for moving across menu items.</li>
            
            <li>Based on my analysis, the inputs for the Google Menu can negatively impact users with visual impairments who rely on a keyboard. Some menu items were unreachable using the keyboard, including the user's saved passwords, which contain sensitive information and help users log into other systems.</li>
            
            <li>The keyboard shortcuts included in the Original Apple Menu threaten accessibility for users who rely on screen readers. VoiceOver announces commands to the user, and it was confusing to hear shortcuts being read aloud, as they conflicted with VoiceOver’s functionality. This could cause users to accidentally force quit or shut down the system.</li>
            
            <li>Mouse users are often prioritized when designing components, which significantly impacts touch users. In modern interactions, mobile usage is more common than desktop interaction. This also presents a mismatch between real-world expectations and designed components.</li>
